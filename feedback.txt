File structure
_ Pictures belong in an assets folder
_ file names should follow camelCase or some-name conventions
_ !! file names should NOT contain spaces !!
Example:
  assets/
    clone-photo.png
    nore.png
    star-wars.png
  sm-clone.html
  sm-home.css
  sm-home.html
  sm-login.html
  sm-signin.html

SM Clone.html  (Sign-In pg)
_ 1 in top-left corner

_ Mobile view looks good

    -- accepts input text
    -- button 'submits' but no :hover states
  - Posts
    -- Looks good
    -- Icons have not active state
_ sidebar
  -- Looks good overall
  -- hover states in sidebar
_ Send buttons
  Good for post

_ !! No mobile view

SM Log-in.html
_ incorrect input types (same as in SM Clone.html)
_ use correct for styles to center btns and texts
  possible sln:
  <form>
    <fieldset>
      <!-- Inputs, Btns -->
    </fieldset>
    <p> <!-- all that text --> </p>
  </form>

  form, fieldset {
    margin: 0 auto;
  }
  p {
    text-align: center;
  }
