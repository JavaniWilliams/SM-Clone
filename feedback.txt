File structure
_ Pictures belong in an assets folder
_ file names should follow camelCase or some-name conventions
_ !! file names should NOT contain spaces !!
Example:
  assets/
    clone-photo.png
    nore.png
    star-wars.png
  sm-clone.html
  sm-home.css
  sm-home.html
  sm-login.html
  sm-signin.html

SM Clone.html  (Sign-In pg)
_ 1 in top-left corner

  > Sign in with Google
  > Forgot Password?

_ Mobile view looks good

_ Widget -- What's happening? 
  -- Where did this come from?

    -- accepts input text
    -- button 'submits' but no :hover states
  - Posts
    -- Looks good
    -- Icons have not active state

  -- Looks good overall
  -- hover states in sidebar
_ Send buttons
  Good for post
  ?? In sidebar
_ !! No mobile view

SM Log-in.html
_ incorrect input types (same as in SM Clone.html)

    <fieldset>
      <!-- Inputs, Btns -->
    </fieldset>
    <p> <!-- all that text --> </p>
  </form>

  form, fieldset {

Requirements:
[G] Use Flexbox or Grid system layout for the basic structure of your elements
[R] Be able to navigate to the different pages. For example, clicking on "Login" should bring me to the login page, filling out the information and clicking "login" should then lead me to the dashboard page. Then, clicking "logout" should bring me back to the home page.
[R] You will have 4 pages that are responsive to screen sizes. Each page will include both mobile and desktop views.
[Y] Separate your CSS files by pages. Do NOT have one giant CSS file

_ Hardcode any text and don't worry about getting information from somewhere else (...for now)
_ You CAN use reusable components from Bootstrap
_ If you want to make something different from your mockup, that's fine, just don't change too much without keeping track of your changes and modifying the mockup if need be.
